# Learning Python with beginners projects

Hey there! :)
In this repository you are able to follow the projects that I've been building while I learn Python.

## My last goals where: :heavy_check_mark:	
1. Installing python 3
    - Checked by the terminal if Python 3 was already installed;	
    - Installed VSCode (*v. 1.69.2*)
      - Installed the main Python's extension for VSCode;
      - Installed Python's indent extension;
    - Installed Anaconda package;
   
2. Dealing with variables
   - Knowing the types of variables that Python works with;
   - Comparing variables;
   
3. The `print()` function & good habits for a cleaner code
    - Practicing the snake_case style;
    - Interpolation;
    - Python's 3 indentation;
    - Using parenthesis;
    
4. The STATEMENTS in Python 
    - `If`... `elif`... `else`;

5. Loops
    - `While`;
    - `For`;
    - `Break`;
    - `Continue`;

6. Working with random numbers
    - How to import `random` module;
    - Usage of `random.randrange()`;
    
## Current steps :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## Next steps :next_track_button:
1. Level & game score
    - Adding levels to the game;
    - Setting a score to the user;
    - Getting familiarized with Python's built-in functions!

2. Organizing the code
